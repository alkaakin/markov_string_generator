## Weekly report pt. 1

# What's been done this week

This week, I've mainly focused on going through the initial course material in Moodle and refreshing my memory on how the related applications, such as Netbeans, work. 

I also participated in the initial lecture of the course. The feeling I had from the lecture was that picking the algorithm and making it work wouldn't be easy, so I decided to contact the course teacher in charge and had a chat with him about how I should approach the topic. 

I first thought of trying to program a rock-paper-scissors AI, but after the discussion we ended up with me trying to build a word generator algorithm based on a Trie structure that will be using Markov chains for trying to infer the words given. There's pseudocode available for this kind of solution, whereas it might not exist for R-P-S, at least not in the same quantity.

Java will be the language for the task. When I first started coding, it was Java. I've been meaning to shift to Python after my couple year break from coding, but Java feels like the safest choice here. 

Concerning the project itself: I received rather good advice for how to build the algorithm. The Trie structure is going to need two methods, one getter and one setter, where the setter receives a string from a list/other source that will be saved to the Trie (while also creating new nodes where needed and updating a frequency counter), and where the getter (a static internal class or a separate class) processes a request based on getting word/other strings from the Trie. So basically, as far as I've understood right, I need a list of words that the algorithm will process so that the words end up (chopped) in the Trie, and then any input I give to the algorithm via the getter method will be prolonged based on the Trie data (using Markov chains somehow - this will need a lot of investigation).

Aside from pondering the above-mentioned, I've set up the needed framework for the task. I'll be coding with Netbeans and using Gradle as the build tool. I have not checked out any testing environments yet nor am I too versed with testing anyway, so I'll have to spend time on that. I have to spend a lot of time on everything, basically, even Git, so it's not going to be an easy task.

# Advances with the program

To be fair, I haven't progressed with writing the algorithm itself - I'm planning to check it out next week. Working with Gradle build file has been harrowing enough so far - the instruction on the Moodle site seem to be a bit old-fashioned, given that Gradle doesn't support some of the scripts anymore. 

# Lessons learned

Despite not having advanced the program itself, I feel like I've learned a lot this week, and I feel optimistic about the rest of the course. I've learned a lot about using Git and Gradle. 

# What is unclear

A lot is still unclear, but this is mostly due to the fact that I haven't delved deeper into the topics. Some unclear things:

1) How are the markov chains implemented algorithmically, and what are they actually about
2) Whether I survive Gradle (Dependencies etc. have been causing trouble already)
3) Will my experience with Java be enough to implement this
4) How the testing works

# What will happen next

Next week, I will look closer at the Trie structure and will try to find the source file for filling up the Trie tree (such as a name database). I will try to create the first prototype of the Trie and make it work (might be that the first version will be done using a readymade Java library implementation).
